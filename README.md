# Image_Prediction_Models
Meant to be a repository of code for classifiers tested on the common CIFAR-10 dataset to log their relative performance

The models are found in the model python package and newer models will be added to the same directory. Currently has resnet and vision transformer implemented.

The vision transformer is based on the keras blogs on transformers.

The dataset used is CIFAR-10 to make a comparision in performance and to perform testing and hyper paramter tuning to choose the best predictor for a given classification problem.

Run main.py and change the models to switch the model architecture
